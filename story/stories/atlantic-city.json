	"intro.1": "So you're on your way from Charleston to Raleigh when you decide to make a quick stop in Atlantic City.",
	"intro.2": "You sit down at a %{betAmount} craps table and the dealer tells you to place your bet.",
	"intro.3": "You don't know anything about craps, so you bet on 12.",
	"intro.4": "The shooter throws the dice, and...",
	
	"firstRoll.won": "Lucky you. Boxcars on the first roll. You snatch up your winnings and leave your %{betAmount} bet to play.",
	"firstRoll.lost": "Crap, you lost your first bet. It's ok, you knew this wouldn't be easy. You make another bet on 12.",
	
	"secondRoll.wonBoth": "What are the odds? Two boxcars in a row, and suddenly you're a gambling addict. You keep playing.",
	"secondRoll.wonFirstLostSecond": "What did you expect? Two wins in a row? But since you're up, you decide to keep playing for a while.",
	"secondRoll.wonSecondLostFirst": "Hey, second time's the charm. Now you're hooked. Maybe you can hit boxcars again.",
	"secondRoll.lostBoth": "Lost again. But now you're invested. You decide to play an even 20 rolls before walking away.",
	
	"firstTable.wonFirstRollsAndWonAgain": "Seriously, you've found your calling. You cancel your pedicure appointment and play another 20 rolls.",

	"firstTable.lostFirstRollsButWonOne": "Hey, you did it. Boxcars. Since you're up, you might as well try another 20 rolls.",
	"firstTable.lostAllRolls": "Nothin'. It must be the table. You slide over to another one and stand next to a man with a white hat and a cane.",
	
	"secondTable.wonBoth": "This is like printing money. \"Drinks all around!\", you say. The dealer reminds you that drinks are free, but you don't even hear him. You just keep playing.",
	"secondTable.wonFirstLostSecond": "Maybe this table just isn't hot anymore. You've tasted what it's like to win, and it's too late to turn back now. You try another table.",
	"secondTable.wonSecondLostFirst": "Yes. It was definitely just that last table. The thrill of vicory compells you on.",
	"secondTable.lostBoth": "Ok, seriously. Two crap tables in a row. What are you going to tell your friends? You've got to win at least once.",
	
	"keepPlaying.tablesSlow": "This is going to be a good investment.",
